# Jakez Story

Okay, here we go.

I have no idea how to do this or if there are any rules I should comply to.

Anyhow, this is it: my story, publicly available.

I solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Because that's a story that hasn't been told before: the truth.

# Sweet Escape

I started working at MeetPeople in Ghent, but unfortunately, I stilled lived at home. I had to drive two times two hours each day to work and back. It seemed a nice company, but I noticed that having a full time job isn't like heaven on earth. I got some tasks I rather didn't execute.

All the time I had to drive every day made me miserable, especially because I didn't want to go home, like ever. Each day I was asking myself, why am I still doing this. There were entire weeks I didn't see my mother sober for just one moment. While driving home, I started thinking 'do I really need to go home, or can I just drive into the river.' I realized, it's happening, again, I need to do something.

One day, my mother went on a trip, together with some guy she met. She was gone for a week. It seemed like a gift from heaven. On a Monday evening, I visited an apartment in Deinze, because that was way cheaper than Ghent. I signed the contract right away and asked if could move in on Saturday. On Tuesday, I blocked my mother's access to my bank account, because if she freezed my money, it was over. There was one more problem I had to tackle. My sister was still at home and didn't want her to notice, so I started putting boxes into the company car I was using one by one. Every day I put some more objects into the car. On Saturday morning, extremely early, I took the last stuff, left a note I was gone (to prevent cops coming after me) and left.

When I left, I smiled, I could finally start my own life. Do my own thing, become a happy person.

As you might have noticed, I haven't been positive about my mother in this story, nor my sister. This is something a lot of people never understood. What did she do so badly that she deserved all of that? Why are you treating her that way? She's still your mother, if she wasn't there you wouldn't be here right now. I have to admit, she gave birth to me. At the time I couldn't explain any of it because I was driven by emotions instead of clear arguments.

It's honestly not that difficult. I left because I wanted to protect myself and that's a natural thing, people want to protect themselves from any harm. This wasn't about having an argument, this was about doing whatever could help me further. Look, call me an egoist, but in the end after all those times I had felt myself so horrible, it was about time I started fixing that. If this kept going on and I eventually did chose the river over home, would I be helping anyone with that? I'm asking because a lot of people have a judgement about the choice I made here.

“But she didn't do anything wrong? She had her own problems and the arguments you summed up weren't that bad. Everyone has some kind of problems within their family.” True, my mother had her own problems. She had this depression probably even before I were born. But this is not about a single problem I had with my mom. It was about a problem I had with myself. Although I did see my mother in a lot of horrible ways, I was shocked the most the moment I saw her when I was looking into a mirror.

There's nothing wrong with having a bad day. Everyone has them. But there definitely is something with feeling horrible and not knowing why. There has to be a reason, not just a feeling.

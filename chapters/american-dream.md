# American dream

Brussels airport, January 2014. I had all documents with me, I did it, I arranged everything correctly. My mother brought me to the airport to wave me goodbye. I checked in the luggage and went to the gate. From the moment I walked into that gate, I knew my life was going to change. While waiting on the plane, I met some of the eleven other people who took the same internship program.

I never felt more happy in my entire life, I was going to do this. I kept on fighting al those years, when I got down, I got up again. Now I was finally going to take my price. I'm not exaggerating here, it was a wonderful experience. I met people from all around the world and some Belgian people as well. I did my internship itself at a non-profit where my work was really appreciated.

I felt like I was actually an American and this was the thing I had been missing my entire life. I made a lot of new friends there. To be honest, some problems did occur, but I usually found a solution. Although, sometimes I got a bit afraid. When I were at a party and I started to feel lonely, I  ran away, just to make sure I wouldn't screw it up. That's one of the things I couldn't explain and I did lose a good friend that way. On a trip to New York, I disappeared as well and I was never able to explain why.

Besides that, it was a wonderful experience and I felt like my life had some meaning, I could start all over. While there, I started to look for jobs in the US and had some interviews scheduled up to find a job there. Although some companies did seem interested, I couldn't get a visa right away. One company offered me to start working from home, but then I had to work from my moms place.

Eventually I started looking for jobs in Belgium and participated in an online interview with a tech company called MeetPeople. That seemed to work out pretty well and their office was located in Ghent, a bigger city than I lived before. As I couldn't stay in the US I made myself a pact. I was going to find a job in Ghent, move there and start over. I was an adult now and no one could stop me in any possible way.

When I landed in Brussels, there was no one there to pick me up at the airport. I didn't know what I expected honestly. So I decided to take the train home. Eventually my mom picked me up at the closest train station. All of that seemed like I was getting back into my old life, but I had a pact. A pact I was willing to keep.

I had some other interviews with MeetPeople and they eventually hired me. I now had a job in Ghent, which was step 1. Now step 2: moving to Ghent. That didn't work out as planned. Whenever I talked about moving out to my mom, she threw all of my clothes out of the window. Because I would leave her with all her misery. That was exactly my plan, but a plan that got delayed.

I finished up my internship documents and graduated college, with high distinction. On a school event I even won an award for being the most atypical student. Like I said, weird doesn't by definition mean bad. I owned it, I won. I fought for years and now I felt I was worth something. I felt I could do anything now.

# Bye bye, principal!

One of the first days of the summer vacation, the school pointed out some updates to its teachers. Apparently, they fired the principal just after the end of the school year. They didn't give any explanation, at least that was what my mom told me. She was apparently shocked by the events and didn't exactly try to hide that. Everyone and everything needed to know how she felt about it. She used to be good friends with the man and that's probably one of the reasons why she got that upset.

But how is any of that related to my story? Well, the action, him getting fired, didn't really affect my life whatsoever. But do you remember Newton's third law? For every action, there is a reaction. It's the reaction that came along with it, the consequences no one thought about.

One of those consequences was my mother being focused on that and nothing else. She wanted to undo what happened, but there was no chance she would ever accomplish that mission. Eventually she met the new principal, her new boss, in matter of fact but hated the guy from the first moment. I never understood why, just feelings I guess.

After some time, her colleagues decided to move on and accept the fact the principal was replaced. My mother couldn't get over it and kept on yelling at everyone they had to support her more and that no one seemed to care. Honestly, I didn't understand any of it and didn't care myself that much. Maybe also because she didn't seem to care how I felt at the time neither.

At the end of the summer, I suddenly heard that I had to switch schools. Well, at first that didn't seem like a bad deal at all. It started to sound worse when I heard I had to switch to another 'level' of classes. My mother tried to convince me to go to a more technical high school. At first, I didn't want to, but then she convinced me it would be better if I wanted to do something with computers later on. I taught myself how to program some basic forms that year and was really interested in computer sciences, so I eventually agreed. Somewhat later, my stepdad admitted that the main reason I had to switch was because I could tell too much delicate stuff at my moms workplace, formerly known as my school aka Satan's waiting room.

So, I went to another school and my mom kept on working at the same, but not for long. After a couple of days, she called in sick and stayed home. She stayed home for days, did no longer talk to people, except for one-way yelling. She now and then started to drink on her own, but it happened more and more often.

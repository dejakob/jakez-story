# Growing up

How did everything get so messed up? If Kelly wasn't the reason, then what was the reason? What's the simple explanation? I'm sorry to disappoint you as a reader, but there's no simple explanation, also there's no 'reason'. From my point of view, I don't believe people who commit suicide had a reason to do it, they just had no reason to live.

Besides, *spoiler alert* I'm not gonna give a reason for what happened, but there's a lot I can explain. Let me take you on a magical journey and that journey starts from the day I were born. That day was the 16th of December in 1992 and it happened in Roeselare, a city in West-Flanders. I'm not gonna be messing with you, I don't remember anything about that day, so let me tell you the things I do remember from my first years as a human being.

I do remember that my parents have been divorced during my entire lifetime. I also remember that I hated my biological father. He was a very bad man and everything about him was horrible. I hated visiting him and got even stressed days before I had to spend a weekend with him. He was also my biggest fear, there was noting or no one I was more afraid of than him. Reasons why he was that bad? No reasons, just feelings...

I also had an older sister, but we never came along. It seemed like I was just another type of person than she was. After a couple of years, I also got a stepfather and we came along way better than me and my sister. However, both of them are only secondary actors in the story I'm trying to tell. I'm sorry about that.

I do remember elementary school, I was sent to a special school. It was a fun school, but a little bit weird sometimes. For example, they didn't have 1st, 2nd and 3rd year but classes such as 1a, then 1b, etc. All teachers were very kind to me and I used to be 'the smartest kid' of my class. Once in a while, I had to go to another weird place. Like a building with doctors who behave like teachers, or teachers who behave like doctors. I didn't really know what kind of species those people were.

After four years of that school, I went to a regular elementary school, but started in the fourth year, so I lost one year that way. I had good grades there as well, but didn't came along that well with the other children. I discovered a passion for computers, but hated sports. Sports were bad and evil, and people who did sports professionally were crazy. What was wrong with those idiots who liked sports? Why I was against it? No reasons, just feelings...

Another person I disliked was Lewis. I disliked him and his entire family. Everything he did was just horrible. He played some instruments at some church club, such an idiot, who does that? His smell, his clothes, ugh terrible. But why exactly? No reasons, just feelings...

One day at school, I had a really bad day. I just hated everything and everyone. I felt misunderstood and wondered if anyone did actually care about me. On the highest floor of the school, there was a hole next to the staircase. A hole that went all the way down to the ground floor. That particular day, I threatened to jump of there, hoping someone would show up and stop me. I cannot give any reason why, just express my feelings.

All of that might seem bad, but elementary school ends one day and then you have to go to high school, where you can make a fresh start.

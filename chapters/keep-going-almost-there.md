# Keep going, you're almost there

One day at school, I got invited to join a meeting about an exclusive internship program in the US. I always had this American dream thing, so I signed up. You needed to have at least 70% on average for all courses so far. Because of that, less than twenty people got an invite for the meeting. Each year, the Flemish government selected twelve people, to sponsor an internship in Washington DC. To qualify, you had to send them a letter and then they decided who would receive the sponsorship.

The chances were really low to get it, but I just had to. It was something I really wanted and would have done everything to make it happen. I wrote the letter and did everything I had to do. Guess what? I got myself in, together with two other people of the school. There was still a year left before the actual internship and I had to fill in an insane amount of documents to get somewhere near a plane. But nothing could stop me, I wanted and I was going to get the internship.

With that in mind, I changed my wallpaper image on my laptop. It was a picture of Washington DC with the text 'keep going, you're almost there'. My teachers also helped me a lot getting things through. With a lot of hope, I finished my second year of college and was already waiting for the third year to begin.

During my last year, I could chose which courses I wanted to take. I chose front end development, audio and visuals, experimental development and android. Most courses required me to make a project and I wanted all of them to be a masterpiece. I was working hard to get my last documents around for the internship and to get all those projects done. I knew I could do it, nothing was going to stop me.

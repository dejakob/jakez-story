# Why did I even write this?

Last week, I binge-watched Netflix' thirteen reasons. It's about a teenage girl who took her own life and left thirteen tapes why she did it. It's a good show, you should definitely watch it as well. I liked how they showed how little problems also could be 'a reason'. Some things didn't seem like a huge deal to a lot of people, but to the main character, it was.

While watching the show, I got angry as well. Especially, the times when she wanted to tell her friend Clay something, but didn't do it. I was thinking like “speak up, talk, say what you have to say”. When she was at the principal's office, I was thinking “come on, open your mouth and say what's going on”. That's why I'm writing all of this. All of it. Because you shouldn't die before letting people know how you feel or think. You should speak up.

That's what I'm doing now. Five years ago, the 24th of April, 2012, something horrible happened. I didn't even have an explanation why. I had a serious problem, I felt bad all the time and sometimes couldn't control my emotions. Nowadays, there are still demons living inside of me, sometimes. You can't always control what happens, but you can control how you deal with it.

I learned a lot during the past years. Everything you feel is about the perspectives you have on the situation. It's all about perspectives. But in order to understand the perspectives someone else has, you need to know the full story.

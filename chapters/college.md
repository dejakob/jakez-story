# College

Besides all of what happened, I could finally go to college. My mother financed me a dorm room, so I finally got some privacy and could start over, once more. It didn't take long before I met my new dorm mates, all of theme were amazing in some way. But the three I will always remember were Alex, Jolien and Maarten. We were friends, I could talk them whenever I wanted to and they were always there to help me. I sometimes still I might have annoyed them a little bit too much with my feelings and didn't listen enough to theirs.

College seemed to be my playground, the courses were pretty easy and fun and I loved what I did: computer sciences, or more specifically: new media and communication technology. I got the opportunity to improve my skills and to learn about a topic that interested me. I tried to stay at my dorm as much as possible, because I didn't like going home.
You might be thinking, if everything was so bloody perfect, why on earth is there a first chapter in this story? As I mentioned before, I'm not gonna write 'the reason', also my college life was pretty great actually. Only one thing I perhaps should mention: it got me confused, in every way possible.

When I met my new classmates, I noticed I was different than them, at least I had different stories to tell. But I wanted them to be my friends, badly. I had to live without friends way too long. So, I did everything I could to force them to like me. I wanted to give parties, I shared code samples with everyone, helped everyone if needed. But maybe, just maybe, I tried a little bit too hard...

The names of some of my classmates will probably no longer surprise you: Jeffrey, Thomas, Caroline and Kelly. When I started college I wanted to make as much friends as possible and to be with people 24/7. I also wanted a girlfriend, badly. I didn't want to be alone ever again. Only problem, I didn't understand how getting a girlfriend worked. Kelly seemed pretty hot, so I decided to do whatever necessary so she would love me.

I sent her the solutions of each exercise we made in class. I bought her a drink almost every day. I helped her out whenever she had a question. When she had no money with her, I paid her lunch (well, she called it borrowing, but I usually didn't get it back). I bought her a birthday gift and I even tried to be friends with her friend Caroline, which was honestly way harder than you would think. Whenever I told Alex, Jolien or Maarten anything about Kelly, they always advised me to stay away from her. I didn't get anything in return and she didn't seem to appreciate anything I was doing for her. I never really stopped trying.

I know what you're thinking, I was a silly stalker. I have to admit, I tried way to hard and put way to much money and effort into it. But if I were a stalker, and she didn't want my attention at all, wouldn't she tell me? I mean she always pretended she didn't want my attention, but whenever I stopped giving her some, she did something to attract my attention. She sent me text messages and teased me in many ways, together with her friend Caroline.

Call me guilty, tell me it was my own stupid mistake. But isn't there a small chance she adored some of the attention? She did use all of the exercises and solutions I gave her. She did even ask for my help sometimes with some exercises. I'm just saying, wouldn't that be a little bit weird if I were her 'creepy stalker'?

Anyhow, like I said, blame it on me all you want, I'm not gonna make the same mistake ever again.

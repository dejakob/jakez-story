# Bye bye, stepfather

During high school, I told the guy from the student help center some things about what was going on at home. Some things, because in the end, they weren't going to solve it. Might seem a little harsh as this guy put a lot of effort in getting me through high school, but still true. One day I told him I had no idea why my stepfather staid married to my mom. I mean how could he possibly think everything was going to be alright?

Turns out he didn't, but wasn't brave enough to admit it. He started seeing other women and no one noticed. He even started renting an apartment without anyone noticing. I had no idea how, but I understood why: he was afraid standing up against my mom. However, I'm not gonna say what he did was the right thing to do. I understood why he wanted to leave, but I hated the way he executed that plan.

My mother got yet another reason to yell and hate everyone. My stepfather moved out and that's how he disappeared out of my life. Well, not instantly, but eventually I lost track of him. Not to be too sentimental here, but for a long time, that guy was my father.

After he left, my mother started talking trash about him. You could probably understand why. One thing was pretty remarkable though. She started calling him 'the beauty' (in a sarcastic way) and 'the man', the exact two things she used to call my biological father.

When time passed by, my sister started to hate the guy. She could no longer tell anything positive about him. I mean, he did something wrong, but before that, he did a lot of things wrong. I didn't understand why my sister got so negative about him. I guess she didn't have a reason, only feelings.

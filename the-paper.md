# The paper

One day I asked the student office to sponsor me a psychologist. I explained I had some problems in the past and they agreed to sponsor. However, I never talked about the things I should have talked about. I just kept on asking how I could force Kelly to love me.

What I should have talked about was my secret investigation. I had a lot of questions about my past and one weekend, I started sniffing through folders at home. I discovered one pretty remarkable piece of paper. It was a court document that was about me and my autism. Apparently, one day a doctor claimed I had more than 66% autism.

Ok, maybe I had some autism, but 66% seemed a lot. Everybody is able to make a mistake, that was probably why another doctor diagnosed me way less handicapped, two years later. But why a court document? Well, the document stated my mother fought against that diagnosis in court. Not the first one, the second one, the diagnosis that described me not being heavily handicapped.

As an outsider, you could now start to think she wanted me to be handicapped. But that makes no sense at all, doesn't it? I didn't ask my mom about it, ever, because I was expecting a lot of trouble and never knowing the truth. I just scanned the document and put it on a save location. This paper was one of the things that made me pretty confused during my first year of college. It wasn't the only thing though.

Most of the times when I went to a party or a social event, I really enjoyed it. But at the same time, it wasn't something I was used to. It felt like I didn't belong there. I had no idea what I had to do, what people expected from me. I often got upset I hadn't had that much social experiences during high school. I mean, I wanted it to change really badly, but I realized I was an adult and I grew up that way.

My whole life I was always hoping for things to get better, like a bright future. I hoped I would live the perfect life during my college years. All those bullies, all those family members, all those bad moments were living in the past. Not only in the past, but also inside of me. Throughout the years, I became a different person. A person who stressed out about getting friends. A person who wasn't very social in the past. I lived a happy life, but deep inside, I was still pretty broken.

So, the 24th of April... What was the reason all that stuff happened? No reason, just feelings. I had no idea why I was feeling worse that day than any other day. Whenever I did start to feel bad, it went down like a rollercoaster, that's a fact. But what was the trigger? Was it Kelly? Was it something else, someone else? It seemed I just hated my life.

When I went back to school, I got my daily life reorganized real quick. I started working extra hard on my projects. I left my sorority and focused on my grades. I got through my first year and got myself a new student job, I worked all summer and was getting back on track.
